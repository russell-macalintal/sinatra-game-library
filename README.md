# SINATRA GAME LIBRARY

This is a Sinatra Web Application that keeps track of User's Games and Consoles Libraries. Once a user has signed up, they have the ability to add games and consoles that other users have created and added to the database or create their own items to be included into their lists. All newly created items will be saved into an ActiveRecord database and will be made available to any logged in user.

Users only have permissions to add or remove items from their own lists and to create new objects to be added to the database. To avoid unauthorized manipulations of game and console details, which could impact the lists of other users, permissions to edit and delete specific game and console objects are restricted only to the ADMIN user.

## Installation
